# Installing Mojaloop 

Mojaloop is packaged and released as a set of helm charts and there are various options for deploying and customising these charts.  
1. The Mojaloop [Deployment Guide](https://docs.mojaloop.io/legacy/deployment-guide/) is intended for those familiar with [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) and [Helm](https://helm.sh) or those interested in the deployment details of the Mojaloop Helm Charts [Deployment Guide](https://docs.mojaloop.io/legacy/deployment-guide/).

2. If you are new to Mojaloop and unfamiliar with helm / kubernetes or if you just want to get the software up and running quickly and simply then the mini-loop install utilities for Mojaloop are an efficient way to get started. The mini-loop scripts enable you to deploy Mojaloop in the cloud or on your laptop / server with just a couple of commands. You can then easily run the Mojaloop Testing Toolkit to interact and test your deployment. [ mini-loop install utils for Mojaloop ](https://github.com/tdaly61/mini-loop)
